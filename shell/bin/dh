# Helper for deleting commands from bash and zsh history

cmd="$@"

# The 'sed' command can take any chararacter as the delimiter character (see
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/9366940). Use '@' as the delimiter instead of '/'
# since it is possible for $cmd to include slashes (e.g. if it includes a
# filepath).
