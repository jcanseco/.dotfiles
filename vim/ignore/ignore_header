# How to interpret this file:
#
# Let us say we want to allowlist 'my/team/project':
#
#   # Ignore all files and directories in the monorepo root
#   *
#
#   # ...except for 'my'
#   !my
#
#   # Ignore all files and directories in 'my' (recursively)
#   my/**
#   # ...except for 'team'
#   !my/team
#
#   # Ignore all files and directories in 'team' (recursively)
#   my/team/**
#   # ...except for 'project' and everything inside it
#   !my/team/project
#   !my/team/project/**
